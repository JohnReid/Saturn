  abstract = {Motif finding is a difficult problem that has been studied for over 20 years. Some older popular motif finders are not suitable for analysis of the large data sets generated by next-generation sequencing. We recently published an efficient approximation (STEME) to the EM algorithm that is at the core of many motif finders such as MEME. This approximation allows the EM algorithm to be applied to large data sets. In this work we describe several efficient extensions to STEME that are based on the MEME algorithm. Together with the original STEME EM approximation, these extensions make STEME a fully-fledged motif finder with similar properties to MEME. We discuss the difficulty of objectively comparing motif finders. We show that STEME performs comparably to existing prominent discriminative motif finders, DREME and Trawler, on 13 sets of transcription factor binding data in mouse ES cells. We demonstrate the ability of STEME to find long degenerate motifs which these discriminative motif finders do not find. As part of our method, we extend an earlier method due to Nagarajan et al. for the efficient calculation of motif E-values. STEME's source code is available under an open source license and STEME is available via a web interface.},

Here we show that sequence specificities can be ascertained from experimental data with 'deep learning' techniques, which offer a scalable, flexible and unified computational approach for pattern discovery. Using a diverse array of experimental data and evaluation metrics, we find that deep learning outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, even when training on in vitro data and testing on in vivo data. We call this approach DeepBind and have built a stand-alone software tool that is fully automatic and handles millions of sequences per experiment. Specificities determined by DeepBind are readily visualized as a weighted ensemble of position weight matrices or as a 'mutation map' that indicates how variations affect binding within a specific sequence.},

  abstract = {Author Summary Genomic regulatory elements (enhancers, promoters, and insulators) control the expression of their target genes and are widely believed to play a key role in human development and disease by altering protein concentrations. A fundamental step in understanding enhancers is the development of DNA sequence-based models to predict the tissue specific activity of regulatory elements. Such models facilitate both the identification of the molecular pathways which impinge on enhancer activity through direct transcription factor binding, and the direct evaluation of the impact of specific common or rare genetic variants on enhancer function. We have previously developed a successful sequence-based model for enhancer prediction using a k-mer support vector machine (kmer-SVM). Here, we address a significant limitation of the kmer-SVM approach and present an alternative method using gapped k-mers (gkm-SVM) which exhibits dramatically improved accuracy in all test cases. While we focus on enhancers and transcription factor binding, our method can be applied to improve a much broader class of sequence analysis problems, including proteins and RNA. In addition, we expect that most k-mer based methods can be significantly improved by simply using the generalized k-mer count method that we present in this paper. We believe this improved model will enable significant contributions to our understanding of the human regulatory system.},

  abstract = {The genetic code—the binding specificity of all transfer-RNAs—defines how protein primary structure is determined by DNA sequence. DNA also dictates when and where proteins are expressed, and this information is encoded in a pattern of specific sequence motifs that are recognized by transcription factors. However, the DNA-binding specificity is only known for a small fraction of the ∼1400 human transcription factors (TFs). We describe here a high-throughput method for analyzing transcription factor binding specificity that is based on systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and massively parallel sequencing. The method is optimized for analysis of large numbers of TFs in parallel through the use of affinity-tagged proteins, barcoded selection oligonucleotides, and multiplexed sequencing. Data are analyzed by a new bioinformatic platform that uses the hundreds of thousands of sequencing reads obtained to control the quality of the experiments and to generate binding motifs for the TFs. The described technology allows higher throughput and identification of much longer binding profiles than current microarray-based methods. In addition, as our method is based on proteins expressed in mammalian cells, it can also be used to characterize DNA-binding preferences of full-length proteins or proteins requiring post-translational modifications. We validate the method by determining binding specificities of 14 different classes of TFs and by confirming the specificities for NFATC1 and RFX3 using ChIP-seq. Our results reveal unexpected dimeric modes of binding for several factors that were thought to preferentially bind DNA as monomers.},

Although the proteins that read the gene regulatory code, transcription factors (TFs), have been largely identified, it is not well known which sequences TFs can recognize. We have analyzed the sequence-specific binding of human TFs using high-throughput SELEX and ChIP sequencing. A total of 830 binding profiles were obtained, describing 239 distinctly different binding specificities. The models represent the majority of human TFs, approximately doubling the coverage compared to existing systematic studies. Our results reveal additional specificity determinants for a large number of factors for which a partial specificity was known, including a commonly observed A- or T-rich stretch that flanks the core motifs. Global analysis of the data revealed that homodimer orientation and spacing preferences, and base-stacking interactions, have a larger role in TF-DNA binding than previously appreciated. We further describe a binding model incorporating these features that is required to understand binding of TFs to DNA.},

  abstract = {The expression of eukaryotic genes is regulated by cis-regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers, which bind sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. One of the great challenges in the gene regulation field is to characterise these elements. This involves the identification of transcription factor (TF) binding sites within regulatory elements that are occupied in a defined regulatory context. Digestion with DNase and the subsequent analysis of regions protected from cleavage (DNase footprinting) has for many years been used to identify specific binding sites occupied by TFs at individual cis-elements with high resolution. This methodology has recently been adapted for high-throughput sequencing (DNase-seq). In this study, we describe an imbalance in the DNA strand-specific alignment information of DNase-seq data surrounding protein–DNA interactions that allows accurate prediction of occupied TF binding sites. Our study introduces a novel algorithm, Wellington, which considers the imbalance in this strand-specific information to efficiently identify DNA footprints. This algorithm significantly enhances specificity by reducing the proportion of false positives and requires significantly fewer predictions than previously reported methods to recapitulate an equal amount of ChIP-seq data. We also provide an open-source software package, pyDNase, which implements the Wellington algorithm to interface with DNase-seq data and expedite analyses.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION
Identification of active gene regulatory elements is a key to understanding transcriptional control governing biological processes such as cell-type specificity, differentiation, development, proliferation, and response to the environment. Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites has historically been a valuable tool for identifying all different types of regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions. This method utilizes DNase I to selectively digest nucleosome-depleted DNA (presumably by transcription factors), whereas DNA regions tightly wrapped in nucleosome and higher-order structures are more resistant. The traditional low-throughput method for identifying DNase I HS sites uses Southern blots. Here, we describe the complete and improved protocol for DNase-seq, a high-throughput method that identifies DNase I HS sites across the whole genome by capturing DNase-digested fragments and sequencing them by high-throughput, next-generation sequencing. In a single experiment, DNase-seq can identify most active regulatory regions from potentially any cell type, from any species with a sequenced genome.},

We used high-throughput protein−DNA binding assays to measure the binding levels and free energies of binding for several human TFs to tens of thousands of short DNA sequences with varying repeat symmetries. Based on statistical mechanics modeling, we identify a new protein−DNA binding mechanism induced by DNA sequence symmetry in the absence of specific base-pair recognition, and experimentally demonstrate that this mechanism indeed governs protein−DNA binding preferences.},

CENTIPEDE, a powerful, probabilistic framework for identifying transcription factor binding sites from tissue-specific DNase I cleavage patterns and genomic sequence content, leverages the hypersensitivity of factor-bound chromatin and the information in the DNase I spatial cleavage profile characteristic of each DNA binding protein to accurately infer functional factor binding sites. However, the model for the spatial profile in this framework fails to account for the substantial variation in the DNase I cleavage profiles across different binding sites. Neither does it account for variation in the profiles at the same binding site across multiple replicate DNase I experiments, which are increasingly available. In this work, we introduce new methods, based on multi-scale models for inhomogeneous Poisson processes, to account for such variation in DNase I cleavage patterns both within and across binding sites. These models account for the spatial structure in the heterogeneity in DNase I cleavage patterns for each factor. Using DNase-seq measurements assayed in a lymphoblastoid cell line, we demonstrate the improved performance of this model for several transcription factors by comparing against the Chip-seq peaks for those factors. Finally, we explore the effects of DNase I sequence bias on inference of factor binding using a simple extension to our framework that allows for a more flexible background model. The proposed model can also be easily applied to paired-end ATAC-seq and DNase-seq data. msCentipede, a Python implementation of our algorithm, is available at  http://rajanil.github.io/msCentipede .},

  abstract = {Summary
Protein-DNA binding is mediated by the recognition of the chemical signatures of the DNA bases and the 3D shape of the DNA molecule. Because DNA shape is a consequence of sequence, it is difficult to dissociate these modes of recognition. Here, we tease them apart in the context of Hox-DNA binding by mutating residues that, in a co-crystal structure, only recognize DNA shape. Complexes made with these mutants lose the preference to bind sequences~with specific DNA shape features. Introducing shape-recognizing residues from one Hox protein to another swapped binding specificities in~vitro and gene regulation in~vivo. Statistical machine learning revealed that the accuracy of binding specificity predictions improves by adding shape features to a model that only depends on sequence, and feature selection identified shape features important for recognition. Thus, shape readout is a direct and independent component of binding site selection by Hox proteins.},

It combines the strengths of previous approaches, and improves robustness by reducing the number of free parameters in the model by an order of magnitude.
Results: We show that Romulus significantly outperforms existing methods across three sources of DNase-seq data, by assessing the performance of these tools against ChIP-seq profiles. The difference was particularly significant when applied to binding site prediction for low-information-content motifs. Our method is capable of inferring multiple binding modes for a single TF, which differ in their DNase I cut profile. Finally, using the model learned by Romulus and ChIP-seq data, we introduce Binding in Closed Chromatin (BCC) as a quantitative measure of TF pioneer factor activity. Uniquely, our measure quantifies a defining feature of pioneer factors, namely their ability to bind closed chromatin.
Availability and Implementation: Romulus is freely available as an R package at http://github.com/ajank/Romulus.

  abstract = {Motivation: Transcription factors (TFs) are a class of DNA-binding proteins that have a central role in regulating gene expression. To reveal mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, a number of computational tools have been proposed for predicting TF-DNA interaction sites. Recent studies have shown that genome-wide sequencing data on open chromatin sites from a DNase I hypersensitivity experiments (DNase-seq) has a great potential to map putative binding sites of all transcription factors in a single experiment. Thus, computational methods for analysing DNase-seq to accurately map TF-DNA interaction sites are highly needed.
Results: Here, we introduce a novel discriminative algorithm, BinDNase, for predicting TF-DNA interaction sites using DNase-seq data. BinDNase implements an efficient method for selecting and extracting informative features from DNase I signal for each TF, either at single nucleotide resolution or for larger regions. The method is applied to 57 transcription factors in cell line K562 and 31 transcription factors in cell line HepG2 using data from the ENCODE project. First, we show that BinDNase compares favourably to other supervised and unsupervised methods developed for TF-DNA interaction prediction using DNase-seq data. We demonstrate the importance to model each TF with a separate prediction model, reflecting TF-specific DNA accessibility around the TF-DNA interaction site. We also show that a highly standardised DNase-seq data (pre)processing is a requisite for accurate TF binding predictions and that sequencing depth has on average only a moderate effect on prediction accuracy. Finally, BinDNase’s binding predictions generalise to other cell types, thus making BinDNase a versatile tool for accurate TF binding prediction.
Availability and implementation: R implementation of the algorithm is available in: http://research.ics.aalto.fi/csb/software/bindnase/.

able to correct for DNase sequence bias and characterize variation in DNA binding

specific transcription factor activity and may offer information about the type of the
interaction between DNA and transcription factor. Our DNase-seq footprint model is
able to accurately discover high confidence transcription factor binding sites and
discover alternative interactions between transcription factors and DNA. DNase-seq

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technologies have allowed many gene locus–level molecular biology assays to become genome-wide profiling methods. DNA-cleaving enzymes such as DNase I have been used to probe accessible chromatin. The accessible regions contain functional regulatory sites, including promoters, insulators and enhancers. Deep sequencing of DNase-seq libraries and computational analysis of the cut profiles have been used to infer protein occupancy in the genome at the nucleotide level, a method introduced as 'digital genomic footprinting'. The approach has been proposed as an attractive alternative to the analysis of transcription factors (TFs) by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), and in theory it should overcome antibody issues, poor resolution and batch effects. Recent reports point to limitations of the DNase-based genomic footprinting approach and call into question the scope of detectable protein occupancy, especially for TFs with short-lived chromatin binding. The genomics community is grappling with issues concerning the utility of genomic footprinting and is reassessing the proposed approaches in terms of robust deliverables. Here we summarize the consensus as well as different views emerging from recent reports, and we describe the remaining issues and hurdles for genomic footprinting.

We studied the key experimental parameters to optimize performance of DNase-seq. Sequencing short fragments of 50–100 base pairs (bp) that accumulate in long internucleosome linker regions was more efficient for identifying transcription factor binding sites compared to sequencing longer fragments. We also assessed the potential of DNase-seq to predict transcription factor occupancy via generation of nucleotide-resolution transcription factor footprints. In modeling the sequence-specific DNase I cutting bias, we found a strong effect that varied over more than two orders of magnitude. This indicates that the nucleotide-resolution cleavage patterns at many transcription factor binding sites are derived from intrinsic DNase I cleavage bias rather than from specific protein-DNA interactions. In contrast, quantitative comparison of DNase I hypersensitivity between states can predict transcription factor occupancy associated with particular biological perturbations.},

A basic premise of footprinting is that sequence-specific TF-DNA interactions are associated with localized resistance to nucleases, leaving observable signatures of cleavage within accessible chromatin. This phenomenon is interpreted to imply protection of the critical nucleotides by the stably bound protein factor. However, this model conflicts with previous reports of many TFs exchanging with specific binding sites in living cells on a timescale of seconds. We show that TFs with short DNA residence times have no footprints at bound motif elements. Moreover, the nuclease cleavage profile within a footprint originates from the DNA sequence in the factor-binding site, rather than from the protein occupying specific nucleotides. These findings suggest a revised understanding of TF footprinting and reveal limitations in comprehensive reconstruction of the TF regulatory network using this approach.},

  abstract = {Transcription Factor Binding Motifs (TFBMs) databases contain many similar motifs, from which non-redundant collections are derived by manual curation. However, the numbers of motifs and collections are exploding. Meta-databases merging these collections do not offer non-redundant versions,because automatically regrouping similar motifs into clusters cannot be easily achieved with available tools. Motif discovery from genome-scale data sets (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) also produces redundant motifs, hampering the interpretation of results. We present matrix-clustering, a versatile tool that clusters similar TFBMs into multiple trees, and automatically creates non-redundant collections of motifs. A feature unique to matrix-clustering is its dynamic visualisation of aligned TFBMs, facilitating and accelerating the analysis of motif collections. It can simultaneously cluster multiple collections from various sources. We demonstrate how matrix-clustering considerably simplifies the interpretation of combined results from multiple motif discovery tools. It facilitates the comparison of ChIP-seq datasets, and highlights biologically relevant variations of similar motifs. By clustering 18 entire databases ($>$5000 motifs), we show that matrix-clustering correctly groups motifs belonging to the same TF families, and can drastically reduce motif redundancy. It is integrated within the RSAT suite (http://rsat.eu/), accessible through a user-friendly web interface or command-line for its integration in pipelines.},

  abstract = {With the continuous expansion of data availability in many large-scale, complex, and networked systems, such as surveillance, security, Internet, and finance, it becomes critical to advance the fundamental understanding of knowledge discovery and analysis from raw data to support decision-making processes. Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.},
