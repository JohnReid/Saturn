# This is a sequence in which a Tigger1 DNA transposon has integrated into a MER7 DNA transposon copy. Subsequently two Alus integrated in the Tigger1 sequence. The simple repeat is derived from the poly A of the Alu element. The first line is interpreted like this:

#   1306    = Smith-Waterman score of the match, usually complexity adjusted
#         The SW scores are not always directly comparable. Sometimes
#         the complexity adjustment has been turned off, and a variety of
#         scoring-matrices are used.
#   15.6    = % substitutions in matching region compared to the consensus
#   6.2     = % of bases opposite a gap in the query sequence (deleted bp)
#   0.0     = % of bases opposite a gap in the repeat consensus (inserted bp)
#   HSU08988 = name of query sequence
#   6563    = starting position of match in query sequence
#   7714    = ending position of match in query sequence
#   (22462) = no. of bases in query sequence past the ending position of match
#   C       = match is with the Complement of the consensus sequence in the database
#   MER7A   = name of the matching interspersed repeat
#   DNA/MER2_type = the class of the repeat, in this case a DNA transposon 
#             fossil of the MER2 group (see below for list and references)
#   (0)     = no. of bases in (complement of) the repeat consensus sequence 
#             prior to beginning of the match (so 0 means that the match extended 
#             all the way to the end of the repeat consensus sequence)
#   2418    = starting position of match in database sequence (using top-strand numbering)
#   1465    = ending position of match in database sequence
